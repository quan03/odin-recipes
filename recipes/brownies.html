    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My favourite brownie recipe; soft on the inside, crusty on the outside.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dark Chocolate (150g)</li>
        <li>Unslated Butter (110g)</li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder (15g)</li>
        <li>Sugar (100g)</li>
        <li>Rum (1/2 shot)</li>
        <li>Large Eggs (3)</li>
        <li>Flour (100g)</li>
        <li>Lightly toasted Pecans (120g)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180 degrees C and place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Line the bottom and sides of a 20 cm square baking pan with foil. Butter the foil.</li>
        <li>Melt the chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl placed over a saucepan of simmering water.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and whisk in the cocoa powder and sugar. Next, whisk in the rum. Then, whisk in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Finally, stir in the flour, salt, and pecans.</li>
        <li>Pour into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with the back of a spoon or offset spatula. Bake for about 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack. Cut up and serve.</li>
    </ol>
